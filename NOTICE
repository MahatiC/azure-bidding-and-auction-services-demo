Code under .devcontainer/scripts comes from https://github.com/privacysandbox/bidding-auction-service and is unchanged. Relevant files already have http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 notice at the top of the file.

Usage of scripts in Dockerfile also comes from the same repository, however it is part of a file which includes our depdendencies.
